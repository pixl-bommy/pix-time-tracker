# pixl-time-tracker

How much time did I spent for which work? Is 'coding' my main task? How often did I got interrupted?

This are just a few thought I questioning myself everyday.

That's why I want to track some statistics for my spent time and I created this project.

## The Idea

I would like to have a little window on one side of my screens, which allows me to quick-switch my current task-category. It should be a small list of buttons, each representing one task. New tasks/buttons should be created easily as soon as they're needed.

## Features

-  **v1.0**
   -  [x] a list of 'task'-buttons should be shown
   -  [x] it's possible to add new 'task'-buttons
   -  [x] new tasks will be stored (local file)
   -  [x] selecting a task, will store it together with a timestamp (local file)
   -  [x] three 'static' task will be shown permanently (end, pause, interrupt)
   -  [x] main menu page
   -  [x] create 'one' button for all views...
   -  [x] buttons may have custom colors
   -  [ ] buttons may have different sizes
   -  [x] tasks can be edit / ~deleted~
   -  [ ] tasks can be deleted
-  **next**
   -  [ ] data can be stored somewhere else
   -  [ ] serve app as mobile website
   -  [ ] it's possible to register an server-app to store data
   -  [ ] statistics can be viewed by day
   -  [ ] statistics can be viewed by week
   -  [ ] statistics can be viewed by month
   -  [ ] statistics can be viewed by year
   -  [ ] statistics can be viewed by individual time span
